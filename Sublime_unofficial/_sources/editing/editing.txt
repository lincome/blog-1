Overview
========

Sublime Text is full to the brim with editing features. This topic just
scratches the surface of what's possible.


Multiple Selections
===================

Multiple selections let you make sweeping changes to your text efficiently.
Any praise about multiple selections is an understatement. This is why:

Select some text and press ``Ctrl + D`` to **add more** instances. If
you want **to skip the current instance**, press ``Ctrl + K, Ctrl + D``.

If you go too far, press ``Ctrl + U`` to **deselect** the current instance.


Transforming Multiple Selections into Lines
===========================================

``Ctrl + L`` expands the selections to the end of the line. ``Ctrl + Shift + L``
splits the selections into lines.

You can copy multiple selected lines to a separate buffer, edit them there,
select the content again as multiple lines and then paste them back into
place in the first buffer.


Other Ways of Selecting Text
============================

The list is long; all available options can be found under **Selection**. To
name a few:

* Select subwords (``Alt + Shift + <arrow>``)
* Expand selection to brackets (``Ctrl + Shift + M``)
* Expand selection to indentation (``Ctrl + Shift + J``)
* Expand selection to scope (``Ctrl + Shift + Space``)


Transposing Things
==================

Need to swap two letters or, better yet, two words? Experiment with
``Ctrl + T``.


And much, much more...
======================

The **Edit**, **Selection**, **Find** and **Goto** menus are good places to
look for handy editing tools. You might end up using just a few of them,
but the rest will still be there when you need them.
