Overview

.. named actions, used everywhere, take json arguments
This list of commands is a work in progress.


About Paths in Command Arguments
================================

Some commands take paths as parameters. Among these, some support snippet-like
syntax, while others don't. A command of the first kind would take a parameter
like *${packages}/SomeDir/SomeFile.Ext* whereas a command of the second kind
would take a parameter like *Packages/SomeDir/SomeFile.Ext*.

Generally, newer commands support the snippet-like syntax.

Often, relative paths in arguments to commands are assumed to start at the
``Data`` directory.

Variables in Paths as Arguments
-------------------------------

The same variables available to build systems are expanded in arguments to
commands. See :ref:`build-system-variables` for more information.
