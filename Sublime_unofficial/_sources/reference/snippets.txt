Fields
******

Mark positions to cycle through by pressing ``TAB`` or ``SHIFT + TAB``.

Syntax: ``$1`` .. ``$n``

``$0``
    Exit mark. Position at which normal text editing should be resumed. By default,
    Sublime Text implicitly sets this mark at the end of the snippet's ``content`` element.

Fields with the same name mirror each other.

Place Holders
*************

Fields with a default value.

Syntax: ``${1:PLACE_HOLDER}`` .. ``${n:PLACE_HOLDER}``

Fields and place holders can be combined and nested within other place holders.

    - ``${var_name/regex/format_string/}``
    - ``${var_name/regex/format_string/options}``

``var_name``
