Incremental Search

The **incremental search panel** can be brought up with ``Ctrl + I``. The only
difference with the regular search panel lies in the behavior of the ``Enter``
key: in incremental searches, it will select the next match in the buffer and
dismiss the search panel for you. Choosing between this panel or the regular
search panel is mainly a matter of preference.
