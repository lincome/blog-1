==================
Search and Replace
==================

Sublime Text features two main types of search:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

	Search - Single File <search_and_replace>
	Search - Multiple Files <search_and_replace_files>

We'll examine them in turn, but let's talk about a powerful tool for searching
text first: regular expressions.

Regular Expressions
===================

Regular Expressions find complex *patterns* in text. To take full advantage of
the search and replace facilities in Sublime Text, you should learn at least
the basics of regular expressions. In this guide we will not explain how to use
regular expressions.

Typing out *regular expression* gets boring fast, and actually saying it is
even more annoying, so nerds usually shorten that to *regexp* or *regex*
instead.

This is how a regex might look like::

	(?:Sw|P)i(?:tch|s{2})\s(?:it\s)?of{2}!

Regexes are known to hurt people's feelings.

To use regular expressions, you need to activate them first in the various
search panels. Othwerwise, the search term will be interpreted literally.

Sublime Text uses the `Boost syntax`_ for regular expressions.
